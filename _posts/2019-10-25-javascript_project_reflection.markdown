This has been the most challenging project for me to date.  I don't believe it has been the most difficult in terms of the material - although JavaScript has definitely been harder to learn than Ruby, at least for me - rather, it was more due to a lack of time.  This year the Jewish High Holidays began at the same time that project week started.  I had been attempting to find pockets of time in between the holidays wherein I could work on the project.  However, this resulted in me having less time to get the project to the point where I felt good about it and more about focusing my energies on getting through the requirements.  The lesson I have been trying to take from this is that sometimes in life I won't have the luxury of time to get things to exactly where I want them.  This made me realize that oftentimes its better to be strategic with the time that I do have and just try to get things to work.  Hopefully at a later date I'll find the time to fine tune everything.

Another big challenge for me was trying not to rush through the project.  I felt pressured to just get it done and I struggled with being present and focused when I did have time to work on the project.  It goes without saying that development needs time and patience.  It requires diligence to systematically debug and move forward and I recognize that I could have been better at that. 

Speaking about debugging, this is something I found more difficult to master in JS than in Ruby. Since error messages are less frequent and less clear, it is hard to figure out where you are going wrong. 

Hmmm... I just reread what I wrote and it sounds quite negative. On a positive note, since Ruby is more of a backend language, its pretty cool that you can see what is happening directly in the browser when you're trying to build some JavaScript functionality.  Also, when you get a feature to work with JaveScript and you see how the DOM is being manipulated, it is pretty magical! 

All in all, I added the JS requirements to my rails project and I look forward to go back and refactor it at some later point to make my project even better.
