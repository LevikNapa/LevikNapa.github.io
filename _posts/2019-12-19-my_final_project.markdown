Can you smell the finish line?! I really can't believe the course is coming to a close, it's been a crazy journey. If I look back to my first weeks, when I started learning Ruby fundamentals, to now, where I'm finishing up my React project, it's quite surprising how much I've learned. I went from not knowing the first thing about code to having learned a full stack in just 10 months, thats nuts! Getting back to this project, learning React has been an experience. Like all the modules up to React, there is a learning curve in getting used to the rules and reasoning of what you are learning. I found that the purpose of the React library really made sense, but it was difficult to wrap my head around how some things worked and were implemented practically. Thats where project week really comes into play, because at this point, your not just reading a bunch of "ReadMe's" and working through some labs, rather your trying to create something on your own from scratch. Its time to put your hard hat on, to go experiment and debug until you get it to work and thats really where things start to click. 


I decided to go conservative with my project, so I could focus on getting the requirements completed, and add onto it if time would allow for it. So I ended up making a journaling app, where you could easily create entries, save the content and edit them. Things got a little tricky when I realized that the way i initially set things up there were a bunch of functional components but only one main container component. That was a problem and I had to refactor and extract some of the code from my form component into a container and only use the original component for displaying data. In general coding in React can get difficult since there are a lot of moving parts. Some components are rendered to the DOM from other components, there are props being passed from parent components, state can be set and updated locally or in your Redux store, so in general the flow of React can take some getting used to, but I feel like I am slowly getting the hang of it.

All in all, the project was a good experience in helping me better understand React, and I look forward to refactoring and adding some features to my project a little down the line.
