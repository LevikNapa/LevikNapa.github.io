This is my first time blogging, so bear with me.

My journey to programming isn't the most glamorous. I didn't have any coding background at all, and I was only made aware of what coding really was pretty recently. After studying at Talmudic seminaries for most of my school years, it was time for me to think seriously about a career path, which field would fit my background best and what I would enjoy. Once I did the proper research, it became clear to me that coding was a really good route to take. It seemed to check all the boxes and fit with my detail-oriented mind and my problem solving background of Talmud. 

I am definitely enjoying what I am learning. At the start of the program, it was a challenge to process all the new information and implement it, but now, although it is still challenging, I do see progress in my understanding of the material, which is really cool. The study of Talmud is a lot about learning a new language, understanding how it flows, and really breaking things down, and in studying code so far, I do see many similar attributes. Another similarity I have noticed is that they both necessitate real consistency. I am absolutely looking forward to continuing this course and excited to develop into a great programmer!
