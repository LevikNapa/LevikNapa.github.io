This has definitely been a real process for me. I don't have any tech background at all, so even just the thought of **creating** a project was quite harrowing. However, now that I am almost finished the project, it really feels like an accomplishment! (even with knowing that I had so much help and support throughout from the Flatiron community, so it wasn't really just me).

I am a big Lakers fan (they really stink now :( ) so faced with a project about scraping a webpage I couldn't go another route. I ended up scraping the lakers roster page from NBA.com and grabbed all the players names on the first scrape. The truth is that for my second level scrape I didn't properly inspect the second webpage beforehand to see what can be scraped, so in the end there wasn't much data to scrape. I did catch a few pieces of data but not as much as I wanted.

All in all, this was a good experience, and although I know that I didn't create the greatest program out there, I really feel like putting what I learned into practice was a big jump for me, in terms of how I am starting to comprehend the material.

My biggest takeaway from the project was allowing myself to overcome my insecurities about asking for help. Whether it was asking my cohort lead or peers, I have always been reluctant to ask, for fear of how silly my questions would seem. In the end though, when I would ask, I would always come out so much more knowledgable, so it became obvious that its just not worth holding back the questions, and everyone is really willing to help. I am not saying that I am over the hump completely in this regard, but it was a big revelation for me during my time working on the project.
