And the journey continues...

I have been experiencing a strange phenomenan during this coding journey. Just as life in general always has its own peaks and valleys, I have found that same experience in the microcosm of coding. Since I began this course a few months ago I experience the "peaks and valleys" sensation very frequently. There have been weeks when I go through the lessons and I feel like wow, I might just be understanding this stuff! Then, as seems to be my custom, I feel completely lost for the next 4 weeks or so. This happened in the weeks leading up to the first project and the same during the time leading to the second project - which I have just completed. The doubt creeps in, telling you that you are crazy for attempting to learn this stuff. Be realistic man... just throw in the towel and move on to something else! Then it happens. Just as I experienced with the first project, when I worked through it and saw what I accomplished, even if it was with a lot of help from the instructors, there sprouts a feeling of hope that maybe, just maybe, I can do this. 

What I take from this is that I must trust the process. The small high that I am experiencing now will certainly turn to despair and helplessness when we start to turn up the heat of the new lessons. What I must keep in mind is that if I tough it out, work hard and trust the process, there will be a peak again.

The project that I created is a fairly simple Sinatra App with a User and tasks they would like to keep track of . Using the Model, View, Controller structure, my App allows one to sign up, login and use CRUD functions on their tasks. Due to lack of time I wasn't able to go much beyond the requirements of the project except for adding Flash messages and AR validations for when a User signs up. I hope to take it further in terms of styling and features when I have some extra time, but for now I am satisfied with where I got with the project.

Until next time...
