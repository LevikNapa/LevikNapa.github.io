It makes sense that the deeper we get into the material, the more complex it becomes. So true to form, this project has definitely been the most challenging for me. I really had to push myself hard to meet all the requirements and I did so to the best of my ability within the time that I had. The toughest part for me was to implement a double nested form. There are so many moving parts to keep in mind, remembering the relationships of my models, adding a writer for the two attributes that were being added to the form of my main model, and following the instances of those objects through the maze of MVC structure and to finally get them to display properly. It took a lot of assistance from my tech coach and lots of 'pry' sessions but eventually I worked through it. 

The lesson I took from my experience with this project was to really take the time to plan out what I want the project to look like and think about the relationships of the models. I put pressure on myself to hurry up and get started with the project and in hindsight, if I would have taken the time to properly plan it out, the experience could have been a lot smoother.

In the end, I did learn a lot during this project and although I still have so much to add in terms of functionality and styling, I feel that there are certain concepts that really became more clear to me through the struggles of working through the project which does makes the challenge worth it.
